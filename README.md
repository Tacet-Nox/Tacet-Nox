## About Me
I am Tacet & I create Batch Scripts that automate processes within Windows. I have been coding in batch using system tools for around 4 years and i enjoy using batch to automate these processes. I am currently working on a Centralised Command Line Interface which will compile all the seperate batch scripts into one.

## What are my Aims?
I am currently aiming to do the User Interface previously mentioned, however I am learning C# which I intend to create Command Line Scripts or GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces)

## Stay Safe & Code Like Your Life Depends On IT!
Make sure you get sleep of course.
