## About Me
I am Tacet and I mostly create Batch Scripts that automate processes within Windows. I have been coding in batch using system tools for around 4 years. I am also interested in powershell scripting which will allow me to create automated processes within windows much easier than batch.

## What are my Aims?
My aim at the moment is to learn powershell scripting more to create a script that will automate the configuration process after installing Windows 10 or Windows 11, this will allow me and you to have your Windows free of telemetry, uneccessary applications installed that you don't use. This is my end goal and just recently started, so this is now underway and looking forward to finishing and releasing the final product.
